# Variant Validation Report Generation (VARG)

```varg``` is a simple tool that can be used to benchmark vcf-files against a truth-set of positive controls.

varg simply finds variants between two vcf-files, finds what variants that are common in the two files (with support for imprecise structural variants)
and aggregate statistics generated from comparisons between each common variant. The user can dynamically enter what fields and columns that should be compared between the vcf-files. ```varg``` supports multi-sample vcf-files.
